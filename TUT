deletion for tree
- 0 children
just delete
- 1 children
replace node with child
- 2 children
check its right child, and go all the way down to the left cornor, and make it the parent
"in the node's right subtree, sleect the left most node, then replace."
- beacuse this node is the smallest in all the right subtrees, but greater than all subtrees in the left.

challange:
construct a bst with:
postorder: R,I,Z,A,O,R,S,K,C,H,E,M
inorder:   R,A,I,Z,M,E,O,R,H,C,S,K
root is M

from inorder we know that things left from M are the left of the tree, and the right from M is the right of the tree
this is hard.....
